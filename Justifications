**Hobart Challenge
The Blue Line provides a creative approach to bring the City of Hobart Flood Prone areas data into the real world to communicate risk and engage the community to act to reduce emissions. We extracted details of streets prone to flooding from the maps and combined this with data on local primary schools to find student participants. These kids will help provide the calls to action and images for wheelie bins. We used the City of Hobart Bin Collection data to determine the days when bins would be out to allow the team to apply the bin stickers and blue lines, representative of flooding.
The Blue Line mobilises the community to action through encouraging participation in simple, individual, local and city wide solutions. These will be student suggested but will most likely focus on reducing emissions (ride your bike) and restoring natural systems (plant a tree).  The Blue Line also builds climate resilience through educating those at risk directly where they live, allowing them to plan and prepare for flooding as well as building a sense of community connection through their shared hopes for their childrenâ€™s futures.

**Creative Data ESG
The Blue Line aims to make flood prone areas explicit through decorating wheelie bins with a blue line and the images of local school children and their calls to action on climate change. As the climate changes, flooding will become worse. Those who live in these streets may not choose to actively seek out information about the level of risk, but the wheelie bins will make this unavoidable and provide simple solutions.  
The aim of The Blue Line is to build a sense of community centred on kids and their vision for the future. As a non-traditional form of media, wheelie bins provide a weekly reminder that actions need to be taken, from planting trees to riding bikes and many other suggestions from local children. The blue lines around the bins remind pedestrians, residents and passing traffic that the streets are a flood zone, and that will help those that live there develop awareness and preparedness.

**Generative AI
The Blue Line aims to connect communities in flood prone areas through the commonality of the weekly bin day by using the wheelie bins as a canvas for communication. The team took advantage of Open Data and Generative AI models to contribute to the project conceptualisation, development and video production. 
Much of the imagery in the video was generated by Mid journey using descriptive text drawn from the project developed through use of data.
Descriptions of the project itself were refined through feeding the video script into Chat GPT to allow for distillation of the essence.  This was re-read and polished by humans.
Music in the video was generated by Soundraw.
In total our team utelised 5 Generative AI technologies to assist in the refinement of ideas for our project.
