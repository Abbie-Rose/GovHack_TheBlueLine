# Project Description
"The Blue Line" is a community project aimed at communicating the urgent need to address climate change and encouraging actionable steps to reduce carbon emissions. Through a combination of visual insertions into everyday environments and child-driven call to actions, we intend to raise awareness, educate, and inspire our community to take meaningful steps towards a more sustainable future.

The heart of the project is “The Blue Line” that represents flood waters, a visceral insertion into communities showing climate change flood risk in their own streets. “The Blue Line” is coupled with climate actions originating from primary school children.

## Child-Driven Climate Actions
Google map data was used to identify primary schools in the greater Hobart area where children were invited to answer the question, “What can people do to solve climate change?”
A selection of children and their responses are then printed out on weatherproof vinyl stickers ready to be stuck onto wheelie bins. 

## Flood Risk Areas
The Hobart flood risk map identified wheelie bins in flood risk areas.

## Getting the Stickers on Wheelie Bins
The roll out into the Hobart area will be planned with the Hobart bin day map, to find when bins were out on the streets. The application of vinyl stickers and “The Blue Line” to wheelie bins will be done overnight and a brochure left in letterboxes in the street. The brochure will suggest localised simple climate actions such as local bus and cycle routes, land care groups and community gardens.

## Why Wheelie Bins?
1.	Everyone has a bin. This commonality is a connection between people who may not have much in common.
2.	The bin is not a ubiquitous part of the environment, it’s not always there. The novelty of the bin appearing once a week jars passersby.

## Data
See data sources and data story.

The Blue Line takes data off the computer and into OUR streets, where it reaches members of our community who may not be online or be aware of climate driven risk. And with their attention we offer them simple climate actions.
